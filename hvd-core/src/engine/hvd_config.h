  // OpenMP's no-nested-parallelism default) predates any real profiling on
  // this project's actual hardware -- it's a plausible-sounding claim, not
  // a measured one. This flag makes it possible to A/B the two strategies
  // without recompiling:
  //   true  (default, unchanged behaviour): parallelise ACROSS fields
  //         (nf/cores fields decode concurrently, each single-threaded
  //         internally). Wins when nf (fields in the chunk -- see
  //         chunk_frames) is comparable to or above the core count.
  //   false: decode fields ONE AT A TIME, same shape as the GUI preview's
  //         single-frame decode -- each field's own internal OpenMP loops
  //         (variational.cpp etc.) are then free to use every core, since
  //         nothing outer is already inside a parallel region. Likely
  //         wins when nf is well below the core count (e.g. small
  //         chunk_frames on a high-core-count machine), where the "true"
  //         setting would otherwise leave cores idle.
  // Only affects the 2D/fast decoupled-field path (sequence.cpp); the
  // slow coupled-temporal path was already serial across fields for
  // correctness (Gauss-Seidel data dependencies), not performance, and
  // is unaffected either way.

  // pedestal for this specific capture (0 IRE for NTSC-J, 7.5 IRE for
  // standard NTSC — see orc_source_parameters.h's black_level_override /
  // has_nonstandard_values), and frame_bridge.cpp already uses it
  // throughout. Re-applying a black-level shift here would double-correct
  // NTSC-J sources and silently corrupt standard NTSC-M ones.

  // amplitude (nominal 20 IRE), as every analogue TV does.

  // Chroma phase correction, in degrees, applied to the burst-locked phase
  // reference (theta) BEFORE it's used to build the carrier — same idea as
  // Comb::Configuration::chromaPhase in the classic decoder (comb.cpp's
  // transformIQ, theta = (33 + chromaPhase) * pi/180), except here it's
  // injected at the actual phase-reference stage instead of rotating U/V
  // after the fact.
  //
  // DEFAULT IS NOW 0, NOT 180. The old 180 existed solely to cancel a sign
  // error in the NTSC burst derivation (lockin.cpp: theta = arg(z) + pi/2
  // where the correct relation is arg(z) - pi/2). That is fixed at source,
  // so this control is once again what it claims to be: a per-capture trim,
  // free for the user to spend.
  //
  // Worse, the old default was actively WRONG on PAL. BurstLockinPhasePal
  // derives theta from the swinging burst independently and was already
  // correct, so the global 180 rotated every 625-line PAL decode by half a
  // turn. Anyone who had dialled this back to 0 to make PAL look right must
  // now leave it at 0 for both standards.
  //
  // On the PAL family the rotation is applied with the V-switch sign (see
  // engine.cpp / sequence.cpp): MakeCarrierPal conjugates the carrier on
  // switched lines, so a naive theta += delta rotates the recovered phasor
  // by -delta on one line parity and +delta on the other — alternating hue
  // error, i.e. Hanover bars, for every value except 0 and 180. Signing the
  // offset by the parity makes the trim uniform and usable at any angle.

  // --- Non-standard subcarrier -------------------------------------------
  // Some composite sources are NTSC in every respect the host measures
  // (line rate, sync, blanking, burst window, 4fsc-nominal sample grid)
  // but carry the colour subcarrier somewhere other than fs/4. The sample
  // RATE does not change; only the carrier riding on that grid moves.
  // The motivating case is JVC VHD, whose subcarrier sits at 2 556 818 Hz.
  //
  // custom_subcarrier is the on/off switch, subcarrier_hz the value, kept
  // separate for the same reason enable_temporal and temporal_strength are:
  // so a dialled-in frequency survives toggling the feature off and on.
  //
  // TYPE IS double, NOT float, unlike every other numeric field here. float's
  // ULP at 4.4 MHz is 0.25 Hz, coarser than the control feeding this, so a
  // float would silently swallow individual spinbox steps and could not hold
  // an exact standard fsc. Everything downstream (FrameParams::subcarrier_hz,
  // FieldGeometry::subcarrier_hz) is already double; this closes the one gap.
  //
  // UNITS ARE Hz. They used to be kHz, and that was not survivable: the host
  // renders every DOUBLE parameter with a hardcoded 4 decimal places
  // (stageparameterdialog.cpp, setDecimals(4)) and no setSingleStep, which a
  // plugin cannot override. In kHz that means
  //   * 4 decimals = 0.0001 kHz, so PAL's 4433.61875 kHz — which needs FIVE —
  //     was literally not typeable; the operator got 4433.6187 or 4433.6188,
  //     i.e. the standard's own subcarrier was unreachable through the
  //     control whose entire job is to reach a subcarrier;
  //   * the default single step of 1.0 stepped by a whole kHz per click,
  //     useless for the "sweep it while watching a flat colour area"
  //     workflow the descriptor recommends.
  // In Hz the same hardcoded 4 decimals give 0.0001 Hz of typing resolution
  // and the 1.0 step becomes 1 Hz per click. Reference values in these units:
  // VHD 2556818.2, NTSC 3579545.5, PAL 4433618.75.
  //
  // MIGRATION: the stage's set_parameters() still accepts the old
  // "subcarrier_khz" key and multiplies by 1000, so projects saved before
  // this change keep their dialled-in frequency. get_parameters() only ever
  // emits the new "subcarrier_hz" key, so a project rewrites itself on the
  // first save.
  //
  // WHAT STILL HOLDS AT VHD. 2 556 818.2 Hz is exactly 162.5 * fH —
  // an ODD MULTIPLE OF HALF THE LINE RATE, structurally the same choice as
  // standard NTSC's 227.5 * fH. So line_advance() comes out at 180 deg and
  // the two assumptions that depend on it stay valid: the AUTO chroma_aniso
  // measurement (its 2-line average still cancels the init's cross-colour
  // leak) and the sequence path's ambiguity measurement (same-parity fields
  // still see the carrier flipped 180 deg). The adaptive modes can be left
  // alone here. The default below is the EXACT line lock 2 556 818.2 (180
  // deg/line); a rounded 2 556 800 gives 179.584 deg/line and quietly
  // breaks both assumptions above. The GUI descriptor used to default to
  // the rounded value while this struct held the exact one — two sources
  // of truth for one default, which is the same class of bug as the old
  // chroma_phase_deg = 180. tests/stage_smoke_test.cpp now cross-checks
  // every descriptor default against this struct so it cannot recur.
  //
  // WHAT DOES NOT. Two carrier nulls are built on fs/fsc == 4 and VHD is at
  // fs/fsc = 5.6, so they stop being nulls:
  //   1. EstimateNoiseIre's stride-4 second difference no longer cancels
  //      chroma; it OVER-estimates sigma, loosening the auto-calibrated
  //      temporal/NR gates.
  //   2. The box-4 low-pass in DetectFieldParity (frame_bridge.cpp) and in
  //      the sequence path's ambiguity gate likewise.
  // Both are fixable exactly for VHD if it proves to matter: 5.6 = 28/5, so
  // 28 samples span exactly 5 carrier cycles — a stride-28 second difference
  // and a box-28 low-pass are exact nulls, at the cost of a wider kernel
  // (28 samples ~= 2 us) passing less luma curvature. Not done here.
  //
  // For a subcarrier that is NOT an odd multiple of fH/2, check
  // FieldGeometry::line_advance(): if it is not ~180 deg, the two assumptions
  // above are actively wrong for the source and the adaptive modes should be
  // replaced by forced values (chroma_aniso 0.5, a fixed temporal_strength).

  // pipeline, which is a richer but much larger alternative architecture
  // deferred for later; see docs/PORTING.md). Wired into HvdEngine::
  // DecodeFrame via an optional list of previous WOVEN FRAMES' raw state
  // (luma/composite/carrier), motion-compensated with MotionCompensatePrev
  // and fed to VariationalRefine's neighbours parameter.
  //
  // enable_temporal is the actual on/off switch — NOT in the Python
  // reference, which just uses temporal_strength == 0 as "off" (no
  // separate toggle needed there since it's a one-shot script, not a UI
  // with a value you want to keep dialled in while flipping 3D on/off).
  // Decoupling them means temporal_strength can default to an actually-
  // useful working value instead of 0, without that turning 3D on by
  // itself — this default (unlike every other value in this file) is NOT
  // from the reference, since the reference has no equivalent "on but at
  // a sensible strength" state; treat it as a starting point to tune, not
  // a verified-correct constant.
  // FIELD ORDER. The TBC stores fields in TEMPORAL order; for a
  // well-formed ld-decode .tbc the FORMAT already fixes the spatial
  // mapping (frames are assembled first-field-first and the first field
  // carries the even frame lines) — so there is nothing to guess. The
  // host API surface, however, exposes no per-field isFirstField, so
  // rather than trusting an assumption across every host/capture, AUTO
  // (default) MEASURES the order from the signal itself: under the true
  // order, each field's lines interpolate the other field's at +0.5 line,
  // under the inverted order at -0.5 — a deterministic half-line vertical
  // correlation test (DetectFieldParity in frame_bridge), decided per
  // frame with a relative margin and falling back to the format
  // convention (field 1 = top) when content has no vertical detail to
  // vote with. 1/2 force the order manually (diagnosis: with the wrong
  // order, static horizontal edges serrate one line and motion combs even
  // through a player's deinterlacer).
  // DIAGNOSTIC MAPS. When non-empty, the sequence export writes, per

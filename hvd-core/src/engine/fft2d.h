// fft2d.h — thin 2-D complex FFT used by the holographic init.
//
// Backed by FFTW3 (single precision). FFTW is declared as a dependency of the
// plugin's own CMake target — the decode-orc SDK explicitly allows plugins to
// bring their own third-party libraries (FFmpeg, FFTW, ...); they are NOT
// inherited from the host. See docs/PORTING.md.
//
// The reference uses numpy's fft2/ifft2 with the standard normalisation
// (forward unnormalised, inverse divided by N). This wrapper matches that so
// the demodulate -> crop -> inverse pipeline in holographic_init is a faithful
// translation. Plans are cached per (height, width) and reused across frames.

  // runtime alongside this project's own -fopenmp one, which caused DLL/
  // symbol conflicts the host's own decode-orc doesn't have — for FFT sizes
  // this small, the speed difference measured as negligible against the
  // OpenMP-parallel IRLS/CG solver that does the actual work). So this is
  // ALWAYS a no-op now: transforms always run on 1 thread internally,
  // silently, regardless of n. Kept (rather than removed) purely so
  // callers — export workers pinning this to 1 per hvd_chroma_decoder_
  // stage.cpp's oversubscription-avoidance logic, and the config_.
  // fft_threads GUI knob — don't need conditional compilation of their own.

// variational.h — the Y/C arbitration solver (the heart of the decoder).
//
// Ports the 2-D (no-temporal-neighbour) path of `variational_refine` from
// `reference/hvd/decoder.py`.
//
// Structural fact that makes this different from a comb filter: the data term
// ||S - Y - Re[chi e^{i phi}]||^2 is *invariant* to transfers between luma and
// modulated chroma — the holographic init already fits the composite exactly.
// So Y/C separation is not a filtering problem, it is an *arbitration* problem.
// We enforce exact data fidelity by eliminating Y (Y := S - Re[chi e^{i phi}])
// and solve, over chi alone,
//
//     argmin_chi  sum rho( grad Y(chi) )
//               + mu_h sum rho_c( Dx chi ) + mu_v sum rho_c( Dy chi )
//
// with rho, rho_c the edge-preserving Charbonnier penalty, solved by IRLS
// (lagged diffusivity) + conjugate gradient. Dot crawl is carrier-frequency
// ripple in Y (huge grad-Y penalty) so it migrates into chi; twin-image /
// cross-colour is a 2fsc oscillation in chi (huge grad-chi penalty) so it
// migrates back into Y. The two classic NTSC artefacts police each other.
//
// The chroma diffusivity is coupled to the luma gradients (parallel level sets)
// so a luma edge opens a matching chroma edge — this removes hanging dots at
// vertical chroma transitions.
//
// NOTE (3-D seam): the reference's variational_refine ALSO accepts
// motion-compensated temporal neighbours — see VariationalRefine below,
// which now ports that too (an earlier version of this file had it
// missing; variational_refine_joint's independent-Y formulation is a
// DIFFERENT, anchor-specific path — see the note on VariationalRefineJoint
// for why conflating the two would have been wrong).
